# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project was meant to help teach me fetch and serverside api's. I started from scratch. The user inputs a city where the input goes through two api's and returns the requested data to the screen. The JavaScript saves the city in local storage and creates a clickable button that will seach for that saved city.

## Usage

The user inputs a city to view the current and forecasted weather for that city. From there the user can either input another city or click on one of the saved city buttons.
